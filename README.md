# Configurations
My windows configurations for uni.
This contains stuff like nvim, powershell profiles, git configuration. I wish to update this with configs for other tools I might use in the future


## Getting Started
First of all, download scoop:
```sh
iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://get.scoop.sh')
```
or
```sh
iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex
```
