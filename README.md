# Configurations
My windows configurations for uni.
This contains stuff like nvim, powershell profiles, git configuration. I wish to update this with configs for other tools I might use in the future.

## Getting Started
<!-- First of all, download scoop:
```sh
iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://get.scoop.sh')
```
or
```sh
iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex
``` -->

Now scoop is installed to 'userprofile\scoop'.
Appliactions installed with scoop reside in 'userprofile\scoop\apps'.

To clone this repo, first install Git for Windows
```sh
winget install -e --id Git.Git
```

With Git for Windows installed, use this command to clone this repo.

```sh
git clone "https://github.com/balits/.config"
```
